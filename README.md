# Basalt-Skript
Basalt is a Skript API, which acts like a Skript addon, adding random things. End goal is to replace at least one Skript plugin.
## REQUIRES...
* Skript (duh)
* Skript-mirror, or Skript-reflect (a great fork of Skript-mirror)
## GOALS
* To add a lot of MiSK's functionality.
* If possible, to add some of SkQuery's functionality.
* Possibly JSON?
## Updates Coming Soon
ðŸ”§ Fixes to Skript bugs using BasaltAPI.
ðŸŒŸ New Syntax from BasaltAPI.
ðŸ“ƒ A few JSON editions.
